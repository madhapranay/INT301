### Question
<h2><b>Implement a network miner tool to detect the operating system, sessions and open ports through
packet sniffing and investigate the network traffic.</b></h2>
___

<h3>In this project, I will be implementing a network miner tool using Wireshark to detect the operating system, sessions, and open ports through packet sniffing and investigating network traffic. Wireshark is a popular open-source packet analyzer that allows us to capture and analyze network traffic in real-time. With Wireshark, I will be able to monitor and analyze the packets flowing through the network and gain valuable insights into the devices, protocols, and services being used.

To detect the operating system, I will be using Wireshark's built-in functionality to analyze the packets and identify the operating system being used by each device on the network. This will involve analyzing the various network protocols and fingerprinting techniques to determine the specific operating system version and vendor.

To detect sessions, I will be using Wireshark to capture and analyze the various network sessions taking place on the network. This will involve analyzing the various network protocols such as TCP, UDP, and ICMP to identify the start and end of each session, the data being transmitted, and the devices involved in the session.

To detect open ports, I will be using Wireshark to capture and analyze the various network packets to identify the ports that are being used by various devices on the network. This will involve analyzing the various network protocols such as TCP, UDP, and ICMP to identify the ports that are being used by different services and applications.

Overall, the project will involve using Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic in real-time and gain valuable insights into the devices, protocols, and services being used on the network. By implementing this network miner tool, we will be able to detect the operating system, sessions, and open ports through packet sniffing and investigate the network traffic.</h3>
